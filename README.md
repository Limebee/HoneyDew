# How It's Made

Tech Used: Javascript, CSS, Node.js, MongoDB, EJS

This a CRUD app built with a node.js backend with mongodb as the database. I organized this project using MVC architecture. I used EJS as the templating language for this project. I used a mixture of vanilla css and Tailwind for this project. This project uses an api to retrieve data for the menu index. The api is called using javascript.




# Optimizations
I would add feature that would allow each order to have multiple different drinks.
